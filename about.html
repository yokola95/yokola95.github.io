    <stories>
    <p class="about-story" id="about-real">We were sitting with some friends. Approximately 1.3 drinks in, we pointed out a picture on the wall next to our table. We asked ourselves, how did we know AI didn't make this image? And with that, SpotAI was born.</p>
    <p class="about-story" id="about-ai">After indulging in a few libations, we noticed an intriguing portrait on the wall of our establishment. As we pondered its creation, the thought occurred to us: what if this artwork was actually produced by an artificial intelligence? And so, with that spark of curiosity, the genesis of SpotAI came to fruition.</p>
